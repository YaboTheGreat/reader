This book was written hastily in August 2006 as the primary course reader for
Math 98/198 at the University of California, Berkeley. We are currently
in the process of preparing a 2nd edition of this text.

auto/ contains some macros for emacs users (whyyyyyy).
test/ contains a memoir-class compilation of the 18 Jan build.

The website for the LaTeX DeCal can still be found at:
